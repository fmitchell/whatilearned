# What I Learned from My First Dev Competition

This is a presentation based off of [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).

## Overview

The best way to learn something new, is to do it. Even better, why not try to win something!

Explore with me the highs and lows of learning the micro-framework Slim PHP, the mapping framework Leaflet.js, integrating with MongoDB, and the Mustache templating framework while trying to win a developer competition put on recently by Jotform.com.

I'll talk about my planning process, how I came up with the idea for my app, my testing process, some pitfalls that I unfortunately fell through, and the analytics I used to assess whether my users were following the assumptions I made when designing the application.

I'll also share some resources I found to help me learn to use the tools for my app and the next steps for my next developer competition entry.
